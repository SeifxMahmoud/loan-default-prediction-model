# loan-default-prediction-model
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict loan default risk using the publicly available Lending Club dataset. The model classifies borrowers into two categories — Fully Paid and Charged Off — based on features such as credit history, loan amount, employment length, and payment behavior.
